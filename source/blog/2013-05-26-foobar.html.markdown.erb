Why are programmers obsessed with using the terms foo and bar in their code?  I’m trying to get a head start on learning Ruby for the course, but if I see another example in a book or online tutorial where the author is so incredibly un-creative that they can’t even think of two descriptive words to use as variables in their code, I’m going to destroy something.


![Foobar](<%= current_page.url %>foobar.png)

Harsh, Shehzan, Shaan, et al, you have been warned…
