Day four is done and I’m writing this with my head on the desk.  It’s not that I’m not used to working long days.  The past four days haven’t even been overly stressful or difficult.  I think the problem is that when I’m at MakerSquare, my brain never has a chance to go on autopilot.  Normally, everyone has those moments in the day where your higher functions sort of “check out”, and you coast along for a little while to let your brain blow off steam.  I’ve noticed that even when I’m not at my computer my mind is running through everything I’ve learned, and I can’t seem to turn it off.  I suppose in some ways that’s a good thing, but I think I need to make an effort this weekend to do some activity that isn’t coding, re-factoring my existing code, reading blogs about coding, etc. 

With all that being said, I’ve learned a ton in the past 4 days.  Most, if not all of the Ruby work has been review for me.  I spent a ton of time prior to the start of the course learning Ruby on my own, so none of the terms or concepts have been anything I haven’t seen before.  Still, while the concepts and terms are familiar, I noticed today that I am starting to write Ruby much faster than I used to be able to, to the point where I rarely have to stop and think about what I’m doing.

What’s been surprising to me is how much I’ve liked learning the front end of things.  I came into the course expecting to gravitate towards the back end of web development, especially with my background writing SQL code. I had done some pre-work on HTML and CSS and wrote them off as a little boring and beneath me.  However, Harsh showed us some example websites from experienced developers and designers and I was blown away by how amazing they looked.

That being said, writing CSS is incredibly difficult.  The thing about SQL and Ruby is, when I look at my code I can have a pretty good idea in my head of what I’m going to get back on the screen.  This is not the case in CSS.  I spent hours today with my head buried in the “Inspect Element” screen of Google Chrome, trying to figure out why the tabs I created this morning wouldn’t line up correctly.  I fixed it by adding another class to my div tag, but I’m sure that will end up biting me in the ass tomorrow. A problem that I’ve noticed with HTML and CSS is, the more elements, tags, classes, ids, etc. that I add to my code, the more problems seem to develop.  

Apparently, this is a common problem among developers.
